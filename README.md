# claude-desktop-buddy (M5StickC Plus **S3** port)

> **Unofficial fork.** This branch ports the upstream firmware from the
> original M5StickC Plus (ESP32) to the newer **M5StickC Plus S3** (ESP32-S3).
> Upstream explicitly does not accept board-port PRs — see
> [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). For the protocol reference and the
> original M5StickC Plus support, see [anthropics/claude-desktop-buddy](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-desktop-buddy).
>
> **What changed for the S3:**
> - `platformio.ini` targets `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` with `M5Unified` (not `M5StickCPlus`)
> - New `src/m5_compat.h` shim maps the old `M5.Axp.*`/`M5.Beep.*`/`M5.Imu.*`/`M5.Rtc.*` APIs onto the M5Unified equivalents
> - RTC struct field names switched to lowercase (`.hours`, `.month`, `.weekDay`)
> - Power button handled via `M5.BtnPWR.wasClicked()` instead of `M5.Axp.GetBtnPress()`
> - LED moved from G10 → **G19**
> - `src/data.h` no longer reads from USB `Serial` — on ESP32-S3 with native USB CDC, `Serial.available()` can deadlock `dataPoll` when no host is actively draining. BLE is the only data channel on S3.
>
> **Flashing an S3 for the first time:**
> StickS3 has no GPIO-0 boot button. To enter download mode: plug in USB,
> then **long-press the side power button until the green LED flashes**
> (3-5 seconds). Only then will `pio run -t upload` succeed. After the
> first flash, `ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1` usually lets subsequent uploads
> reset into download mode automatically.

## Related Repository

- Bridge repo: [`therealarnold666/codex-buddy-bridge`](https://github.com/therealarnold666/codex-buddy-bridge)
- This firmware repo owns the StickS3 device side (UI/animation/power/BLE peripheral).
- The bridge repo owns host-side hooks, daemon state model, and approval workflow integration with Codex.
- Both repos are designed to run together over BLE NUS + JSON snapshots.

## Additional Delta In This Branch

Beyond the baseline S3 port, this branch also includes behavior and power
model changes for Codex Buddy integration:

- Session/turn-driven state UX alignment with `codex-buddy-bridge`
  (`running/waiting/idle/sleep` transitions tuned for short BLE connects).
- Display/power policy updates:
  - battery-only auto off/dim rules by state
  - screen-off loop throttled for lower idle draw
  - BLE advertising duty-cycle in screen-off battery mode
- UI/wording updates:
  - Codex naming in UI copy
  - Credits page extended with local fork attribution and source block
  - Normal page HUD centering/word-wrap tuning
- GIF runtime behavior fixes:
  - non-sleep single-GIF states (notably `busy`) loop continuously
  - clock page and normal page render-size consistency
- Stats model updates:
  - token deltas accumulate from bridge and persist locally
  - energy restore rules include long sleep and USB+idle recovery behavior
- Hardware-path adjustments for this project profile:
  - IMU-facing logic disabled in current branch build
  - side power key no longer used as app-level screen-toggle control

Claude for macOS and Windows can connect Claude Cowork and Claude Code to
maker devices over BLE, so developers and makers can build hardware that
displays permission prompts, recent messages, and other interactions. We've
been impressed by the creativity of the maker community around Claude -
providing a lightweight, opt-in API is our way of making it easier to build
fun little hardware devices that integrate with Claude.

> **Building your own device?** You don't need any of the code here. See
> **[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)** for the wire protocol: Nordic UART
> Service UUIDs, JSON schemas, and the folder push transport.

As an example, we built a desk pet on ESP32 that lives off permission
approvals and interaction with Claude. It sleeps when nothing's happening,
wakes when sessions start, gets visibly impatient when an approval prompt is
waiting, and lets you approve or deny right from the device.

## Hardware

The firmware targets ESP32 with the Arduino framework. As written, it
depends on the M5StickCPlus library for its display, IMU, and button
drivers—so you'll need that board, or a fork that swaps those drivers for
your own pin layout.

## Flashing

Install
[PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/),
then:

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

If you're starting from a previously-flashed device, wipe it first:

```bash
pio run -t erase && pio run -t upload
```

Once running, you can also wipe everything from the device itself: **hold A
→ settings → reset → factory reset → tap twice**.

## Pairing

To pair your device with Claude, first enable developer mode (**Help →
Troubleshooting → Enable Developer Mode**). Then, open the Hardware Buddy
window in **Developer → Open Hardware Buddy…**, click **Connect**, and pick
your device from the list. macOS will prompt for Bluetooth permission on
first connect; grant it.

  <img src="docs/hardware-buddy-window.png" alt="Hardware Buddy window with Connect button and folder drop target" width="420">
</p>

Once paired, the bridge auto-reconnects whenever both sides are awake.

If discovery isn't finding the stick:

- Make sure it's awake (any button press)
- Check the stick's settings menu → bluetooth is on

## Controls

|                         | Normal               | Pet         | Info        | Approval    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **A** (front)           | next screen          | next screen | next screen | **approve** |
| **B** (right)           | scroll transcript    | next page   | next page   | **deny**    |
| **Hold A**              | menu                 | menu        | menu        | menu        |
| **Power** (left, short) | toggle screen off    |             |             |             |
| **Power** (left, ~6s)   | hard power off       |             |             |             |
| **Shake**               | dizzy                |             |             | —           |
| **Face-down**           | nap (energy refills) |             |             |             |

The screen auto-powers-off after 30s of no interaction (kept on while an
approval prompt is up). Any button press wakes it.

## ASCII pets

Eighteen pets, each with seven animations (sleep, idle, busy, attention,
celebrate, dizzy, heart). Menu → "next pet" cycles them with a counter.
Choice persists to NVS.

## GIF pets

If you want a custom GIF character instead of an ASCII buddy, drag a
character pack folder onto the drop target in the Hardware Buddy window. The
app streams it over BLE and the stick switches to GIF mode live. **Settings
→ delete char** reverts to ASCII mode.

A character pack is a folder with `manifest.json` and 96px-wide GIFs:

```json
{
  "name": "bufo",
  "colors": {
    "body": "#6B8E23",
    "bg": "#000000",
    "text": "#FFFFFF",
    "textDim": "#808080",
    "ink": "#000000"
  },
  "states": {
    "sleep": "sleep.gif",
    "idle": ["idle_0.gif", "idle_1.gif", "idle_2.gif"],
    "busy": "busy.gif",
    "attention": "attention.gif",
    "celebrate": "celebrate.gif",
    "dizzy": "dizzy.gif",
    "heart": "heart.gif"
  }
}
```

State values can be a single filename or an array. Arrays rotate: each
loop-end advances to the next GIF, useful for an idle activity carousel so
the home screen doesn't loop one clip forever.

GIFs are 96px wide; height up to ~140px stays on a 135×240 portrait screen.
Crop tight to the character — transparent margins waste screen and shrink
the sprite. `tools/prep_character.py` handles the resize: feed it source
GIFs at any sizes and it produces a 96px-wide set where the character is the
same scale in every state.

The whole folder must fit under 1.8MB —
`gifsicle --lossy=80 -O3 --colors 64` typically cuts 40–60%.

See `characters/bufo/` for a working example.

If you're iterating on a character and would rather skip the BLE round-trip,
`tools/flash_character.py characters/bufo` stages it into `data/` and runs
`pio run -t uploadfs` directly over USB.

## The seven states

| State       | Trigger                     | Feel                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `sleep`     | bridge not connected        | eyes closed, slow breathing |
| `idle`      | connected, nothing urgent   | blinking, looking around    |
| `busy`      | sessions actively running   | sweating, working           |
| `attention` | approval pending            | alert, **LED blinks**       |
| `celebrate` | level up (every 50K tokens) | confetti, bouncing          |
| `dizzy`     | you shook the stick         | spiral eyes, wobbling       |
| `heart`     | approved in under 5s        | floating hearts             |

## Availability

The BLE API is only available when the desktop apps are in developer mode
(**Help → Troubleshooting → Enable Developer Mode**). It's intended for
makers and developers and isn't an officially supported product feature.
